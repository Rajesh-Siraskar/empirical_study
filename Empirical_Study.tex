\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The 14th-century friar, William of Ockham, has been attributed for giving us the "Occam's razor" principle -- when there are two competing "theories" predicting the same phenomenon, one should prefer the \textit{simpler} of two.

In this empirical study, we document the performance of a simple, early reinforcement learning algorithm, REINFORCE, implemented for a predictive maintenance problem. We compare a very naive implementation of REINFORCE against the predictions of industry-grade Stable-Baselines3 (SB-3) implementations of three advanced algorithms, namely, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our broad goal was to understand the performance under various scenarios such as a simulation-based environment, three sets of real tool-wear data, added noise levels, and a random chance of break-down. Model performance was measured by how accurately the predictive maintenance agent suggested tool replacement compared to a deterministic preventive maintenance rule based on the tool-wear threshold. 

Our findings indicate that the REINFORCE performs significantly well for this particular problem. Across variants of the environment, the REINFORCE algorithm demonstrated an average F1 performance of 0.836 against 0.383 for A2C, 0.471 for DQN, and 0.402 for PPO. As a measure of stability, the overall standard deviation for REINFORCE was 0.041, while A2C, DQN, and PPO standard deviations were 0.059, 0.029, and 0.070, respectively. Across precision on tool replacement, REINFORCE was better by 0.354 basis points than the best of advanced algorithms and demonstrated a variance lower by 0.004. While the REINFORCE demonstrated better performance for each variant, it was observed that the training was unstable, occasionally producing poor performance models. On the other hand, the SB-3 implementations training was more stable, almost always producing models with an F1 in the range 0.47-0.50.

\section{Introduction}
Introduced in 1992, the REINFORCE algorithm is considered as a basic reinforcement learning algorithm. It is a policy-based, on-policy as well as off-policy algorithm, capable of handling both discrete and continuous observation and action domains.

In practice the REINFORCE algorithm is considered as ``weak" learner and superseded by several algorithms developed since. Most notably the Q-Learning and its deep-neural network version, the DQN, followed by Actor-Critic and one of the most robust modern day algorithms, the PPO.

Initial gradient-based approaches such as finite differences gradients or REINFORCE
(Williams, 1992) have been rather slow. The weight perturbation algorithm is related to
REINFORCE but can deal with non-Gaussian distributions which significantly improves
the signal to noise ratio of the gradient (Roberts et al., 2010). Recent natural policy
gradient approaches (Peters and Schaal, 2008c,b) have allowed for faster convergence
which may be advantageous for robotics as it reduces the learning time and required
real-world interactions.

\section{The REINFORCE algorithm}
Three key features of any RL algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Policy: $\pi_\theta$ = Probablities of all actions, given a state. Parameterized by $\theta$
	\item Objective function:
	\begin{equation}
		\max_{\theta} J(\pi_{\theta}) = \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta} [R(\tau)]
	\end{equation}
	\item Method: Way to udate the parameters = Policy Gradient

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Policy gradient numerical computation}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Plain vanilla: 
	\begin{equation}
		\nabla \theta J(\pi_\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta} \; [ \; \sum_{t=0}^T R_t(\tau) \; \nabla_\theta \ln \pi_\theta(a_t \vert s_t) \;]
	\end{equation}
	\item With Monte Carlo sampling and approximation: $\nabla_\theta J(\pi_\theta) \approx [ \; \sum_{t=0}^T R_t(\tau) \; \nabla_\theta \ln \pi_\theta(a_t \vert s_t) \;]$
	\item With baseline: $\nabla_\theta J(\theta) \approx [ \; \sum_{t=0}^T (R_t(\tau) - b(s_t)) \; \nabla_\theta \ln \pi_\theta(a_t \vert s_t) \;]$
	\item Where, baseline does not change per time-step, it is for the entire trajectory
	\item One baseline option: $V^\pi$ - leads to Actor-Critic algorithm
	\item Simpler option: Average returns over trajectory: $b = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=0}^T R_t(\tau) $
\end{enumerate}

Algorithm
%1. Initialize $\alpha$, $\gamma$ and $\theta$ i.e. weigths of the NN
%2. for episodes = 0 to MAX_EPISODES:
%- sample trajectory $\tau$
%- set $\nabla_\theta J(\pi_{\theta})$ = 0
%- for t=0 to T:
%- $R_t(\tau) = \sum_{t'=t}^{T} \gamma^{t'-t} r'_t$
%- $\nabla_\theta J(\pi_\theta)  = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta} \; [ \; \sum_{t=0}^T R_t(\tau) \; \nabla_\theta \ln \pi_\theta(a_t \vert s_t) \;]$
%- end for sampled trajectory
%- $\theta = \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta J(\pi_\theta) $
%3. end for all episodes 
%
%Implementation notes:
%1. Code is inspired by Laura Graesser's (LG, 2020 book) implementation, however with large modifications
%2. We use the concept of Agent (instead of 'pi' or '$policy_pi$') and a separate network class (i.e. how the function approximator is implemented, it could well be a linear regression)
%3. **Important concept**: "Loss" in the implementation below, is the "objective" $J$. In our algorithm, we want to **maximize** it. PyTorch's optimizer, by default, MINIMIZES it (as it is called "loss"), we therefore add "-" negate it, so as to maximize it. 
%4. Also in the final plot, notice "loss" is RISING and follows the rewards, which is expected as "loss" is really being maximized.  
%5. self.pd.probs = prob. distribution of all actions
%6. Sum of all possible action probabilities = 1.0
%7. Note that episodes > 300 start showing repeated patterns. Rewards drop and rise in cylces. 300 is ideal and hence suggested in LG (2020)

\section{About Stable-Baselines-3}
\begin{itemize}
	\item SB3- paper \citep{SB3}, \cite{SB3}
	\item sb-3 main doc -- \citep{SB3-main-doc}
	\item sb-3 ppo doc -- \citep{SB3-PPO-doc}
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}

We normalize the tool wear and other state features, $x \in [0,\;1] \subset \mathbb{R} $. This allows for adding white noise of similar magnitudes across experiments of different data-sets
